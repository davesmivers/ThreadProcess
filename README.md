 ThreadProcess Example: File Worker

ThreadProcess Example: File Worker
==================================

This is an example demonstrating the usage of the `ThreadProcess` class for file writing and reading operations. The `ThreadProcess` class provides a framework for executing and managing long-running threads or processes, allowing for concurrent and asynchronous operations.

Usage
-----

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/thread-process.git

2.  Import the necessary classes:

    from threadProcess import ThreadProcess

3.  Create a subclass of `ThreadProcess` to handle file operations. In the subclass, override the `startup()`, `request_handler()`, and `cleanup()` methods:

    
    class FileWorker(ThreadProcess):
        def startup(self, **kwargs):
            # Perform initialization tasks, e.g., open the file
    
        def request_handler(self, command, uuid, parameters={}):
            # Process individual requests, e.g., write to or read from the file
    
        def cleanup(self):
            # Perform cleanup tasks, e.g., close the file
      

4.  In the `__name__ == '__main__'` block, create an instance of the `FileWorker` subclass:

    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Create an instance of FileWorker for writing
        file_writer = FileWorker(filename='knockknock.txt', mode='a', type='thread')
    
        # Send write requests to write to the file
        file_writer.request('write', {'message': 'knock knock'})
        file_writer.request('write_backwards', {'message': "who's there"})
    
        # Send a quit request to the worker process/thread and wait until it is processed
        file_writer.quit(blocking=True)
    
        # Create an instance of FileWorker for reading
        file_reader = FileWorker(filename='knockknock.txt', mode='r', type='process')
    
        # Send a readlines request to read all lines from the file
        file_reader.request('readlines', {'message': 'knock knock'})
    
        # Print each line read from the file
        for line in file_reader.response(blocking=True)[-1]:
            print(line)
    
        # Send a quit request to the worker process/thread
        file_reader.quit()
      

5.  Run the script to execute the file operations.

Please make sure to replace `filename='knockknock.txt'` with the actual filename you want to read from or write to.
